🌟 Gemini AI Clone

A modern Gemini AI Clone built using React.js, designed to replicate the smooth and intelligent chat experience of Google Gemini.
This project focuses on responsive UI, AI-like interaction flow, and modern design elements to deliver a realistic and dynamic chat interface.

🚀 Features

💬 Interactive Chat Interface — Real-time messaging UI inspired by Google Gemini.

🎨 Modern Responsive Design — Styled with CSS

🔄 Dynamic Sidebar — Collapsible sidebar with hover animation and menu control.

🧠 AI Response Simulation — Mimics intelligent replies (can be integrated with real APIs like OpenAI or Gemini API).

⚡ React Hooks & State Management — Clean, reusable components built with modern React practices.

💡 How It Works

The Gemini AI Clone simulates an AI chat interface where users can:

=> Type a message in the input field.

=> Get simulated or API-driven AI responses.

=> Manage chats and navigation from a responsive sidebar.

You can easily integrate OpenAI or Gemini API to make it fully functional.
